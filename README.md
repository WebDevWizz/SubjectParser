# SubjectParser
A project focused on extensively testing a Java class called `SubjectParser`.

### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Code Coverage**: The test suite covers each method in `SubjectParser`, using the "Coverage-based" Testing (a structural testing type -> White Box)
- **Testing of Core Functionalities**:
  - **getId()**: Verifies the extraction of numeric identifiers from the input string.
  - **getTitle()**: Tests title extraction.
  - **getThisRange() and getUpperRange()**: Confirms the accuracy of extracting numeric ranges.


### Project Goals:
This project aims to:
1. Demonstrate the use of JUnit for testing complex Java classes (with JUnit 4).
2. Provide an example of best practices for testing, such as covering edge cases and handling exceptions.
3. Highlight the importance of testing in the software development process.
